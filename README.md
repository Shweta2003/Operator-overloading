# Operator-overloading

## Problem :

-> Take input of 2 time values in format
   [hour : minute]
   
-> Make a menu driven program in C++ to add the time or subtract one from another

-> Make a member function to add the 2 time values

-> Make a friend function to subtract smaller time value from bigger time value

-> Return the reult in terms of minutes

-> Take input values and display using friend functions istream and ostream
